# CBC Tutorials with Clarke

Welcome to the CBC tutorials repository!

This is where you can find a variety of helpful tips and tricks for phylogenetic analyses, and just general neat things to do in R. Please email me at <vsteenderen@gmail.com> if you have any questions or suggestions.

## For phylogenetic tutorials, please download the following software:

* Chromas (free version 2.6.6) http://technelysium.com.au/wp/chromas/

* AliView http://ormbunkar.se/aliview/ or https://github.com/AliView/AliView

BioEdit is also widely used, but I prefer AliView as it can be used on multiple operating systems https://bioedit.software.informer.com/7.2/

* Notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

* R https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ 

* RStudio https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

* FigTree https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases

* Tracer https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases

* PopART http://popart.otago.ac.nz/downloads.shtml

We'll go through using Inkscape later, for graphical editing https://inkscape.org/

## Useful online servers:
